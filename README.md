# Assignment5---Collab



-If one player leave or disconnect, remaining pplayer (as long as 2 or more) would continue quiz, but it would (should) update them

-Immediately reveals answer upon submission, but updating score is delayed until all players have made their choices

-All users synchronize at start so neither gets a 'headstart' on any given round, in terms of how much time they have

-We were unable to (correctly) confirm that the roll/pitch should work, even though in theory it should, looking at our code. We needed to use a computer on the Mac lab, also since only one of us has a working iPhone it was difficult to set it up.


For debug purposes:
Product -> Scheme -> Edit scheme -> Run -> Under environment vars, add 'OS_ACTIVITY_MODE' with value 'disable'
(this cleans garbage output in console)
